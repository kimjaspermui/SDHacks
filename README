this program keeps track of the number of empty spaces available 
inside of a parking structure by use of a camera installed at the 
entrance of the parking structure. The camera takes note of when a vehicle 
either enters from the bottom side of the camera which denotes the entrance
(or a car entering the structure) or from the top half of the camera which 
denotes a car leaving the structure. The program will know how many parking 
spots are available in an empty structure and from there whenever a car enters
the number of spots available will decrease by one and vice versa for a leaving
car. The number of available spots is uploaded to a GUI that will show the 
number of spots available in a certain floor.(but it only works for floor 1
*work in progress)

three terminals are used in the process of running this application each one 
requires 1 step which are as follows
1. enable the camera by running the unix script "camera.sh" by typing 
   ./camera.sh which will produce an image named "test.jpg" 
2. run the software that detects the car entering or leaving the structure by 
   typing "java CarDetection2" in a seperate terminal which will produce a 
   txt file containing the information used by the GUI application, the file is 
   named "gilman1.txt"
3. run the GUI by typing "make" in the third terminal which will use the 
   information stored in "gilman1.txt" and translate it to the program.
